My 3rd project is an interactive, 2-player Javascript game! Each player will take turns rolling a random, virtual dice until one of them reaches a score of 100. "Sounds easy" one might say. Well the twist is a player's turn is gone when they roll a 1, so make sure to hold your score before that happens! Would appreciate any feedback if you played the game or look at my code :)
